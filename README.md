## Principles

- **Non-injection and Non-invasive**: Ribir interacts with the APIs of your data struct, and does not require you to do any pre-design for the user interface. The developer can focus on designing the data struct, logic and APIs. Ribir will neither break your existing logic nor require injecting any of its own objects.

- **Declarative**: The user interface is the description of data, the description will automatically react to the data modifies. Once you describe your data, the description will always describe your data.

- **Purely composed**: Ribir creates UI across widget. There is no a base object exist, even if the built-in fields are provided in a compose way. For example , only if you use `margin` field, the `Margin` widget will be composed, if you do not use it, you don't pay any overhead for `Margin`. "Only pay for what you need" is an important guideline for Ribir.

## Key Features

- **Write once run anywhere**: Compile native code for desktop and mobile(not yet), and WASM for Web(not yet). Since Ribir has very few platform dependencies, it's not hard to provide more platforms by yourself.
- **Declarative language expanded from Rust syntax**: The declarative language is based on Rust, so interaction with Rust becomes natural and easy.
- **Easy custom widget**: Ribir supports the implementation of custom `Compose`, `Render` and `ComposeChild` widgets, you only need to implement the corresponding trait. Even you can specify the template of the children of `ComposeChild`, just across derive the `Template` trait.
- **Powerful custom theme**: Specify the theme for the whole application or partial subtree. In the theme, you can configure the palette, icons, animate transitions, widget custom themes, the interactive behavior of widget and even compose more decoration widgets on it.
- **Rich available official widgets**: A `ribir_widgets` library existsï¼Œcontaining common desktop and mobile widgets.
- **No side effect animations**: Animation in Ribir is only a visual effect, and not effect data. Animate support for any render widget.
- **Alternative rendering backends**: The rendering backend is replaceable, you can implement your own rendering to output image, html, svg or any other stuff. Ribir provides a gpu backend based on [wgpu] and maybe a soft(cpu) render in the future.
