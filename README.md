## Principle

**Non-injection Non-invasive**: Ribir directly interact with the APIs of your data struct, does not require you to do any pre-design for the user interface. The developer can focus on to design the data struct, logic and APIs, Ribir will neither breaks your existing logic nor requires injecting any of its own objects.

**Declarative**: user interface is the description of dataï¼Œthe description will auto reactive to the data modifies. Once you described your data, the description is always describe your data.

**Purely Composed**: Ribir create UI across widget. There is not a base object exist, even if the builtin fields is provided in a compose way. For example only if you use `margin` field, the `Margin` widget will be composed, if you not use it, you don't pay any overhead for `Margin`. "Only pay for what you need" is an important guideline for Ribir.

## Key Features

- **Write once run anywhere**: Compile native code to desktop and mobile(not yet), and WASM for Web(not yet). Because Ribir has very few dependencies on platforms, it's not hard to provide more platform by yourself.
- **Declarative language expanded from Rust syntax**: The declarative language is base on rust, so it interaction with Rust becomes natural and easy.
- **Easy custom widget**: Ribir support implement custom `Compose`, `Render` and `ComposeChild` widget, only need to implement the corresponding trait. Even, you can specify the template of the children of `ComposeChild`, just across derive the `Template` trait.
- **Powerful custom theme**: specify the theme for whole application or partial subtree. In the theme you can config the palette, icons, animate transitions, widget custom theme, the interactive behavior of widget and even compose more decoration widget on it.
- **Rich available official widgets**: a `ribir_widgets` library existï¼Œcontains common desktop and mobile widgets.
- **No side effect animations**: animations in Ribir is only an visual effect, and not effect data. Animate support for any render widget.
- **Alternative rendering backends**: the render backend is replaceable, you can implement your own render to output picture, html, svg or any other stuff. Ribir provide a gpu backend base on [wgpu] and maybe a soft(cpu) render in future.
