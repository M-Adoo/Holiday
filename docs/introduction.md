# Introduction

Ribir is a framework for building modern, native/wasm, cross-platform user interface application.  

In Ribir's principle, we encourage to focus on data structure and logic first, and then to create the user interface when we design an application. Ribir will neither break the data structure nor require injecting any of its own objects. We'll insist this principle in subsequent demos.
