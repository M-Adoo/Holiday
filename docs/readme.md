# Ribir Documentation

Please place all asset files in the 'assets' subdirectory within the respective language directory. This helps us manage the versions of assets that correspond to the documentation when we build the website.

Since all assets are linked to the same folder, if you need an image for a specific language, create a new image with the language code as a suffix. Please avoid overwriting the original image.
