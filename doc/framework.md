## Declare & Reactive programming mode

`Holiday` builds widget tree with your ui by declare data, meanwhile it creates render object tree to layout and paint.
When the data that the widget depends on changes, widget tree will make a update, and render objects correspond updated widgets to update also.

Wnen a widget as root node run in `Application`, it will be inflated into widget tree by `Holiday`. Every leaf in the widget tree is a rendered widget. Sometimes, only tree has updated is not enough, it's possible that `CombinationWidget` builds a complete differently `Widget` at last. In these scenes, corresponded subtree need to rebuild. Because every widget must explicit provide a rebuild emitter or not by `RebuildEmitter` trait, so the widget tree know how to efficient rebuild a subtree across the widget diff algorithm. `Holiday` will implement a `RebuildEmitter` for every widget, so it's not a burden to implement a widget. Widgets also have a chance to implement it by itself, because a widget know which time need to rebuild really, and how to have the best performance. 

## Rebuild Widget Subtree Diff Algorithm

Widget doesn't update or rebuild subtree immediately when its rebuild emitter emitted. It's just mark this widget need to rebuild and wait until the widget tree rebuild. 

The widget tree update from top to bottom. If a bottom widget removed because its ancestor rebuild, its update or rebuild auto be canceled. Even if `CombinationWidget` require rebuild, that not mean `Holiday` will reconstruct the total subtree, the `Key` may help us to reduce many cost in some case.

### Key

`Key` helps `Holiday` to track what widgets add, remove and changed. So `Holiday` can modify the widget tree and the render tree minimally. A `Key` should unique for each widget under the same father.

The widget tree rebuilds base on widget diff. Work like below:

a. build widget from `CombinationWidget`.
b. if new widget's `Key` is equal to the last time build widget in the widget tree ?
  1. use new widget replace before sub tree in widget and mark this widget dirty.
  2. if this widget is `CombinationWidget`, use new widget recursive step a.
  3. else, if this widget is render widget and has children.
    * pluck all children from widget tree.
    * process new children one by one
      - if a old child can be found by new child's key in plucked children.
        * insert old child back.
        * recursive step 1.
      - else add new widget in the widget tree, and recursive step c.
      - destroy the remaining plucked child and subtree, correspond render tree destroy too.
  4. else done.
c. else, inflate the new widget and use the new widget subtree instead of the old in widget tree, reconstruct render subtree correspond to this widget subtree.
d. done, the subtree from this widget is rebuild finished.



### Signature ?

`Key` is used for widget, and `Signature` used for the render object. Unlike `Key` to identify if this widget is a same widget with before. `Signature` guarantee that if two same type render objects have same `Signature` that mean the have same content and will paint same thing. So `Holiday` can treat all render objects as one, if they have same type and same `Signature`.


## Compose prefer

Unlike many classic GUI framework, `Holiday` doesn't build on inherit mode. Because Rust not support inherit, `Holiday` built base on composition. For example, If you want give a `Button` widget opacity, it doesn't have a field named `opacity` give you to set the opacity, you should use a `Opacity` widget to do it, like:

```rust
Opacity {
  opacity: 0.5,
  Button! { text: "Click Me!"}
}
```

### zero cost for compose ?


## RenderObject & RenderTree 

The widget tree corresponds to the user interface, and `RenderTree` is created by RenderWidget do the actually layout and paint. In this vision, widget is build cheap, and RenderObject is more expensive than widget.

## Update Data

When we build a widget from `CombinationWidget`, framework provide a `BuildContext` param, and the `NodeId` of the widget build in the ctx, use the `NodeId` framework can provide State<Self> to change widget state when reactive user interactive. 

### Layout

`Holiday` performs a layout per frame, it's a recursive layout from parent down to children. There is some point to help write a layout:

There only three type size render object can be:

1. Fixed Size, a constant size gave before layout.
2. Expand Size, auto size defect by itself content or children size.
3. Bound Size, auto size defect by its parent layout.

if a render object is Expand Size, its children can't have Bound Size. In general, when perform a layout, fixed size children should be first perform, then expand size and bound size last.


## Children Relationship

In `Holiday`, normal render object not hold the children, but we can use layout widget to build a parent & children relationship.
